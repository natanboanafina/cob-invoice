# THIS ACTIVITY PURPOSE
```
  This is an activity purposed by my Cobol professor and made by myself.
  It was needed to create two sequential data files to be open and read. After
  all of this made, I had to compare the ID data contained in one file, search
  for its equivalent ID in the second data file so I can write a third data
  file containg the client's name, the product name and the product price.
```

## The Data Files Structure
```
  CLIENTS.DAT contains the ID and the Name choosen by me. This file works as a
  parameter to find the equivalent id in COMPRAS.DAT file.

  COMPRAS.DAT contains a list with 10 clients ID, Goods Bought by the client ID,
  the name of the goods bought and the goods price.

  NF.DAT is the result of the comparison between the ID create in the first file
  and the ID contained in the second file.
  Once the ID was found, I had to move the respective client name, the goods bought
  and the goods price.
